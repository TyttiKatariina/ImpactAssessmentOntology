# ImpactAssessmentOntology

Abstract
IAO (Impact Assessment Ontology) is an ontology for expressing the requirement of a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) based on the requirements of the GDPR (Article 35), European Data Protection Board (EDPB) DPIA guidelines and the national specific guidelines from Data Protection Authorites (DPA) from all 27 EU member states and 3 EEA countries. IAO assists organisations with determining when their processing of personal data requires conducting a DPIA, taking into consideration the jurisdictional requirements depending on where in the EEA the processing is taking place.
